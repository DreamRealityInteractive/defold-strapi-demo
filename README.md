# Defold Strapi demo

This project displays data fetched from a Strapi CMS server.
Specifically, it displays 'restaurant' data from the Strapi live demo which you can register for at https://strapi.io/demo

Demo server access is time-limited but you can register again using an email of the format your_normal_username+extra_chars@your-email_host

Modify the server details at the top of main.gui_script to match the server you were allocated.
